* Why learn q ?
  - fast (/faster than Python or R/) and big data ready. Why?
      - code lives right next to the data, so no transmission cost
      - kdb+ is columnar DBMS, so optimal use of locality during full-table scans
      - in-memory when real-time; historical on disk stored column-wise and sequential read (in 4,096 blocks)
      - terse
      - vector-based ops are very fast (SIMD, SSE, AVX512 ...) while loops can be avoided in most cases
      - compact data structures optimised to use L1 and L2 caches
      - column attributes optimise qsql queries
      - parallelisation built-in natively (functional programming)
      - clever optimisations and reuse of just ~50 primitives
  - well-established, growing, well-paid, well-integrated with other tech
* Where is it useful?

  - finance
  - blockchain - trade processing platform [[https://kx.com/blog/kx-technology-integrated-into-innovative-blockchain-trade-processing-platform/][Cobalt DL: trade processing plaform]]
  - any industry with real-time analytics or big data needs (recently IoT, manufacturing, retail, space, ...)
